## Synopsis
Negotiation path draw a graphic view of a negotiation dynamic.
In a negotiations a visual description is useful to help the word description. 
The script provide this translation. 



## Code Example
By using two classes (dinamic as the whole negotiation, and stato as each important step is taken during the negotiation process) and the plot library matplotlib.pyplot the script allow the translation in an image of a dynamic of a negotiation. 
Charge your own text files with your cases of negotiation in the directory called dynamics.

	

## Motivation
A negotiation may be depict in many way. 
One of the must common is use an analysis of how much actors involved are: 
collaborating and satisfacted. 

By a simple text file compilation, saved in the directory called “dynamics”, the user can create the visual path of a negotiation. 

Many example of negotiation are available at Ambiente ingegneria webpage http://web.aing.biz/index.php/2015/07/25/nego/


## Installation
The script only needs Python 2 intalled.
Then, only execute the negot_path.py file in the same directory you download the main file:
	python negot_path.py


## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests
The script is provided with a test file (called “negot_path_test.py”) for testing. 

## Contributors
The main help may be improve the plot by adding features.
